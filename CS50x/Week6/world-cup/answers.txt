Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

with a low number of runs like 10 the probability of results is not enough

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

at 1000 the simulations
